  <h3>Raytracer</h3>
  <p>Using equations and tips from <a href="https://mitchellkember.com/blog/post/ray-tracer/">an incredibly helpful blog by Mitchell Kember</a>,
    I made a simple raytracer in Python. Right now, it only handles diffuse reflection. In the future, I hope to add specular reflection, anti-aliasing, and transmittance.
    I'm currently looking into using parallelization to speed up render times.

    The <a href="https://github.com/foxn31/Raytracer">repo</a> includes progress pics and my attempt at converting the code to C++. 
    Raytracer.py is the current working program.
